### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Choose between 4 simple operations and exit the calculator.

## My process

This project is my first experience with Python, although it is a very simple and common challenge, I'm very proud of the result, it has been a good exercise, I was able to do it in only one day.
Learned basic sintax and indentation.


### Built with

- Python

### What I learned

Python sintax.
Indentaion.
Different IDE (PyCharm)

### Continued development

I'll make a couple projects in python to get used to it, to have a little expertise on a backend tech stack.
